## 🎯 Translation Best Practices

### Keep Consistent

**Technical terms:**
- "Framework RACE" → "RACE Framework"
- "Développeur augmenté" → "Augmented developer"
- "Productivité" → "Productivity"
- "ROI" → "ROI" (unchanged)
- "Tests unitaires" → "Unit tests"

**Common phrases:**
- "Quick Start" → "Quick Start" (keep English)
- "Manager" → "Manager" (unchanged)
- "Lead time" → "Lead time" (unchanged)

### Adapt Examples

**Before (French):**
```
Exemple : Une équipe de 5 développeurs...
```

**After (English):**
```
Example: A team of 5 developers...
```

### Maintain Tone

- Professional but approachable
- Use active voice
- Keep the friendly, encouraging tone
- Preserve emojis
